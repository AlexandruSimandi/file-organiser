# File organiser

Simple script that groups every file in the current dir based on type.

Unknown types by this script are left unharmed

Run 
```
npm install
npm install -g enclose
enclose --loglevel info -o <output_executable> ./organiser.js
```
then move the executable in the desired folder and run it. (it does not support params, yet)

Or you can trust me and download the already compiled exe for Windows :)

Or you could move everything in the desired folder and run
```
npm install
node organiser.js
```
But that is just silly.
