# File organiser

Simple script that groups every file in the current dir based on type.

File types unknown by this script are not moved.

Run 
```
npm install
npm install -g enclose
enclose --loglevel info -o <output_executable> ./organiser.js
```
then move the executable in the desired folder and run it. (it does not support params, yet)

Or you can trust me and download the already compiled exe for Windows from [here](https://github.com/AlexandruSimandi/file-organiser/releases) :)


Or you could move everything in the desired folder and run
```
npm install
node organiser.js
```
But that is just silly.
